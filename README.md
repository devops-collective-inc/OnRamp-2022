# OnRamp 2022

![DevOpsCollective](images/OnRamp2022.png)

The repository contains class material for the OnRamp 2022 program which is part of the [PowerShell+DevOps Global Summit](https://powershell.org/calendar/powershell-devops-global-summit-2022/). All items are offered as educational material. Nothing in this repository should be construed as material to use in a production environment.

The video recordings are too large to directly store in Github. They are stored using Github LFS. To view the files you will need to download the mp4 file to your desktop.
