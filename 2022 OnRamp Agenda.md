# OnRamp 2022 Agenda

<img src="images/PowerShell-transparent-thumb.jpg" alt="Ms. PowerShell" halign="left" align="left"> This is what you can expect for your OnRamp week.
Your schedule includes attending keynotes and major events in the main conference. You are also invited and encouraged to attend all evening social events. These events are what makes this conference special. Breaks are scheduled to coincide with the main conference so you will have opportunities to mingle and network.

## Attendance

It is expected that you will attend all OnRamp sessions.
You are __not__ permitted to jump back and forth between OnRamp and main conference sessions.
We have a lot of material to cover and we will be starting sessions on time.

## Course Material

We will be using the OnRamp Slack channel for communications.
If you have questions or comments that you don't feel comfortable asking during the day, please use this channel.
This is also a great way to network with other attendees.
Presentation material, including slides and sample code will be available on Github at [https://github.com/devops-collective-inc/OnRamp-2022](https://github.com/devops-collective-inc/OnRamp-2022).
You don't need a Github account to access the site.
You will able able to download a zip file of all content from the site.

## Your Host

The OnRamp program has been developed with you in mind. The content is designed for beginning IT professionals who want a jump start on their IT career, with an emphasis in automation and Devops. Guest speakers will present some material based on their expertise.

### Jeff Hicks

Jeff Hicks is one of the "old guard" of the PowerShell world.
He is one of the early  Microsoft PowerShell MVPs, a well-known author, conference speaker and teacher.
When he isn't writing PowerShell-related books or creating courseware for Pluralsight, you can find him walking the dog, doing a crossword puzzle and enjoying a nice glass of wine, bourbon or scotch.
Although, probably not all at the same time.
You can follow him on Twitter as [@JeffHicks](https://twitter.com/jeffhicks).
Jeff posts regularly at [https://jdhitsolutions.com/blog](https://jdhitsolutions.com/blog)
