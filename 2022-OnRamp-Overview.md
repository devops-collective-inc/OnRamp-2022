# OnRamp 2022 Overview

The OnRamp program returns for a second year, after a difficult hiatus, with a refined focus and direction. This program is targeted for the new or up-and-coming IT professional looking to get a head start on automation, DevOps and cloud technologies as well as learning more about what a career in IT looks like today. The content will be a mix of traditional presentation, demonstration and hands-on exercises led by veteran IT professionals and teachers. This is *not* an instructor led PowerShell fundamentals course.

Attendees of of the OnRamp will attend some of the content from the main conference track and the remaining time will be devoted to their own agenda. Conference and OnRamp attendees are expected to adhere to a single track. Due to the nature of the OnRamp agenda, jumping between tracks is not allowed.

## Agenda

OnRamp attendees will have their own agenda that should include these topics:

+ An Introduction to Automation and DevOps Technologies, Tools and Concepts
+ An Introduction to Azure Cloud Technologies
+ What it means to be an IT Professional in 2020
+ Essential PowerShell Skills
+ PowerShell Remoting Fundamentals
+ An Introduction to PowerShell Scripting and Toolmaking

This is not a complete agenda and some content is subject to change. There will be plenty of opportunity for hands-on exercises. Detailed requirements will be announced later but if you can run Windows PowerShell or PowerShell Core and Visual Studio Code you should be fine.
